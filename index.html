          1. The quiz consists of 10 questions <br />
          <br />
          2. The quiz is divided into 2 sections: first 5 questions form the
          level 1 and next 5 forms the level 2 <br />
          <br />
          3. For each right answer in level 1 the participant's score will be
          updated by 1000 and in level 2 it will be updated by 2000 <br />
          <br />
          4. After completing 5 questions the participant will be entered to a
          safe zone <br />
          <br />
          5. If an answer goes wrong the participant will be immediately
          terminated from the quiz and gets an amount in safe zone only if
          he/she gets there. Otherwise no amount will be given <br />
          <br />
          6. For eg: if a participant answers correctly for first 3 qns but gave
          a wrong answer to the 4th one then that participant wont get any
          amount. But if he crosses the safe zone and if he/she gives a wrong
          answer for example if the participant gives a wrong answer for the 6th
          qn then the participant will get the safe amount. <br />
          <br />
          7. On successful completion of the quiz the participant will be given
          a cash amount of Rs.15000
